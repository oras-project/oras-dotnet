/// Repository is an ORAS target and an union of the blob and the manifest CASs.

/// blob may be resulted in an `UnsupportedException` error. However, this interface
/// does not restrict tagging blobs.
/// Since a repository is an union of the blob and the manifest CASs, all
/// operations defined in the `IBlobStore` are executed depending on the media
/// type of the given descriptor accordingly.
/// Furthermore, this interface also provides the ability to enforce the
/// separation of the blob and the manifests CASs.
